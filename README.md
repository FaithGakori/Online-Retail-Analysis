### The analysis process;

#### First, I assure you that Iâ€™ve provided the most up-to-date and error-free analysis. After loading the data into my software, I scrubbed any records with negative quantities and unit price, as these records needed to be removed to provide helpful analysis.

##### Trend of the revenue to observe seasonality in the store sales. My analysis shows that there are some months of the year where exceptional growth is witnessed. The data shows that the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly constant as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $685k. The increase in revenue starts in the month of September, where the revenue increases by 40% over the previous month. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.5 million USD, the highest during the entire year.This analysis shows that the retail store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the year.

#### The second visual shows how the top 10 countries that have opportunities for growth are performing. This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand. The analysis shows that countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes of units bought and revenue generated. I would suggest that these countries should be focused on to ensure that measures are taken to capture these markets even more.

#### The third analysis has been performed on the top 10 customers who have purchased the most from the store. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 3% more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to generate the revenue. 

#### Finally, the last 2 visuals show the top 10 products by quantity and revenue. The analysis shows that products with stock code 'DOT', '22423' and '23843' generate the highest revenue for the store.
